## Website Organization - 

* index.html - Contains the HTML style code for the front page 
* calendar.html - Contains link to the calendar which is hosted using deeplearningcmu10417@gmail.com email address - This link is an embedded link which consists of a week based view. Users can switch to month based view easily on the website
* index_cp.html - This html page is not in use for the website - Just a copy of index.html page for quick reference. Fast to debug changes between index.html and index_cp.html to understand issue during any changes.
